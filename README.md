NoWound - Game built onKinect for physiotherapy patients

Platform:
The project has been coded on Kinect v2.0, using C# for making the game, while php has been used for the localhost server linking the game to the server.
Once, you start the game, the kinect records your movement, and the corresponding data is updated on the dashboard.
